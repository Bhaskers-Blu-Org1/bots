This type of risk is associated with people who borrowed money and who are unable to pay for the money they borrowed. As such, these people go into default. Investors affected by credit risk suffer from decreased income and lost principal and interest, or they deal with a rise in costs for collection. Liquidity risk involves securities and assets that cannot be purchased or sold fast enough to cut losses in a volatile market. Asset-backed risk is the risk that asset-backed securities may become volatile if the underlying securities also change in value. The risks under asset-backed risk include prepayment risk and interest rate risk. Changes in prices because of market differences, political changes, natural calamities, diplomatic changes or economic conflicts may cause volatile foreign investment conditions that may expose businesses and individuals to foreign investment risk. Equity risk covers the risk involved in the volatile price changes of shares of stock.
