If the rescuer is alone, the patient's lungs should be filled with three or four rapid mouth-to-mouth respirations before attempting to massage. Ideally, both artificial respiration and massage are performed at the same time by two rescuers. There is no need to coordinate the two activities between the rescuers. In massage, the rescuer puts one hand across the lower sternum (breast-bone) of the patient. The other hand is placed on top to make a right angle. The full weight of the rescuer is applied rhythmically through the heel of the hands, at about one thrust per second. The sternum moves in about 4 or 5 centimeters (1.5 to 2 inches), compressing the heart. When pressure is lifted, blood reenters the heart.
